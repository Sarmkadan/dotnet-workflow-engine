## ValidationException

The `ValidationException` class represents validation failures in workflows or activities. It contains a list of validation errors, the name of the entity that failed validation, and provides a detailed error message. Use it to handle and log validation issues during workflow execution.

Example usage:
```csharp
try
{
    var activity = new Activity { Name = "", Duration = -1 };
    WorkflowValidator.ValidateActivity(activity);
}
catch (ValidationException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Validation failed for {ex.EntityName}:");
    Console.WriteLine(ex.GetDetailedMessage());
    // Output: Validation failed for Activity. Errors: Name cannot be empty; Duration must be positive
}
```
